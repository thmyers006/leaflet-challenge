Earthquakes and Data Visualization

This project takes a look at earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey or USGS.
Specifically, this website is a visualization of earthquakes of 2.5 magnitude and higher all over
the world.  It uses the USGS GeoJSON Feed that is updated frequently to locate and map the
different earthquakes. 

The code uses D3, JavaScript, Leaflet and Mapbox to create the visualizations presented here.

Leaflet-Step-1 shows the earthquake data and Leaflet-Step-2 shows the earthquake data and a 
representation of tectonic plates provided courtesy of another github contribution:

Assistant Daniel Doyle and Student Tutor Steven Thomas. Thank you for your help.
